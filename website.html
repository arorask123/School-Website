The Srijan SchoolSpread over two acres and housed in a thoughtfully designed building in Model Town, Delhi, The Srijan School, recognized by the Directorate of Education, aims to achieve a programme that seamlessly combines the time-tested, traditional methods of the gurukul with modern techniques, adjusted to changing times in order to provide a complete learning environment for your child.

'Srijan', which means 'creation', endeavours to partner the overall learning process and development of your child, starting from the early years. Progressive and secular in its philosophy, The Srijan School, follows a child-oriented approach, looking upon each child as an individual and providing an educational programme which stresses the importance of the total development of the child â€“ head, heart and hand.
